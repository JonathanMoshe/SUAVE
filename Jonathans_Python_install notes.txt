Search Windows for "edit environment variables for your computer"
In the window that pops up, under the 'Advanced' tab, click 'Environment Variables'
In the System variable window, find the Path variable and press 'Edit'
Select the 'New' button and add the following 3 Python paths at the end of the list:
"C:\Users\jmoshe\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39"
"C:\Users\jmoshe\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts"
"C:\OpenVSP-3.26.1-win64-Python3.9\OpenVSP-3.26.1-win64\python\openvsp\openvsp"

Installing Python should also install the packages installer, called Pip.
Verify it is installed by running the following command in cmd:
pip --version
If it doesn't run the following command in cmd:
python get-pip.py

Now install the required packages by running the following commands:
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install sklearn
pip install plotly

Now you can install SUAVE
Create a directory where you want to install SUAVE, i.e. C:\SUAVE
From this directory, excute the following command...
python setup.py develop

Open "C:\Program Files\OpenVSP-3.26.1-win64\python\openvsp\openvsp\__init__.py" (or wherever you installed OpenVSP)
Reorder "from .vsp...." to line 2 instead of line 1.

To get openVSP to work with SUAVE...
Navigate to C:\OpenVSP-3.26.1-win64-Python3.9\OpenVSP-3.26.1-win64\python (or wherever you installed this)
Git Bash in here... 
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Added to env. vars..
c:\program files\openvsp-3.26.1-win64\python\openvsp\openvsp\

In this folder...
C:\Users\jmoshe\OneDrive - Genesis Air Mobility\Documents\GitHub\SUAVE\trunk\SUAVE\Input_Output\OpenVSP
Opened each .py file and change "import vsp as vsp" to "import openvsp as vsp"

To use git within VScode (after installing git)
Open terminal...
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "YourEmail@YourDomain"
To check if set up correctly...
